The VMF format is just a convenient ASCII vector map format which has 
been especially designed to work with sunclock. It is inspired by 
xearth's original format, by Kirk Lauritz Johnson.

We now come to the more precise VMF specifications

==============================================================================


#!VMF is the initial signature for the format

Any character # indicates a comment until a newline character is found

The first two data specified should be 2 numbers:
 num_colors  (number of distinct colors used in the map)
 max_palette (maximum of numbers used to code colors)

Then, a list of <num_colors> explicit RGB values or conventional names
of colors should follow, in the format understood by the XAllocNamedColor()
Xlib routine.
 
The next value is the default color. Colors are indicated by their index in
the range  0 .. N  where N = num_colors-1

The next data are the palette values, given in the form  
(color --> list of codes):
c0  j1 j2 j3 ...
c1  k1 k2 ...
c2  l1 l2 l3 l4
c4  ...
(etc)
cN  u1 u2 ...
.

Do not forget the final point to indicate that the palette values are complete.
The meaning of this is that codes j1 j2 j3 will be attributed color 0
(first listed color), codes k1 k2 will be attributed color 1 (second listed
color), etc. All codes should be in the range 0 .. max_palette

The next value is the "background value", that is the color code which will
be affected to all pixels, before the codes are modified by drawing objects 
on the map.

The next data are arrays of short (16-bit) ints, defining closed
curves drawn on the map. The vector map algorithm fills the interior of 
each curve with a prescribed color, and leaves the outside of the curve 
unmodified; however, if some pixels in the interior already carry colors, 
the effect of the coloring scheme is to combine colors together -- 
precisely by adding their codes.

 - the first value in an array is the number of points of the curve
 - the second value in a curve indicates the color code value with a 
   plus or minus sign, depending e.g. on whether the curve should add a new
   domain with the given color code, or should dig a hole in a previously
   drawn domain with the given color code.
 - the next values are the point coordinate values [theta, phi] 
   where theta is the longitude (between -180 and 180 degrees)
   and phi the latitude (between -90 and 90)
   rescaled as short integers in the range -32760 ... 32760
 - normally, the curves should be non-self-intersecting and traced in a
   counter-clockwise orientation (An incorrect orientation can be
   coped with by negating the corresponding color code).
 - if there are several curves bounding overlapping domains, the color code
   obtained in the intersection is just the sum of color codes produced
   by each curve (that is, the color code in the interior of the curve and
   0 outside). In that case, it might be preferable to use color codes which
   are e.g. powers of 2 (or more), so that colors don't mix without things
   being controllable. The practical limit on the code values is 2^15-1.
