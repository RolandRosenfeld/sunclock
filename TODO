- Replace the bitmap image by a vector map which will allow the
  sunclock map to be rescaled in an arbitrary way. This is in my agenda 
  for the forthcoming version 3.20 -- it should be not so hard to do
  as everything is already implemented in xearth and analogues, and
  we just need to plug these nice features in...

- Supplement the bitmap or vector image by colorful pixmaps of Earth. 
  This would make the program more pretty -- but would also make it
  have a larger memory footprint without substantially increasing
  the functionality...
