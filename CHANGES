==============================================================================

Planned versions 3.30, 3.40... (features to appear in some order)

- Possibility of zooming the maps
- Larger data base of cities/coordinates, with level of size
- Searching cities
- Moon phases
- Possibility of loading external vector maps (?)
- Spherical representation of Earth (?)

Version 3.28, January 15, 2001

- Patch in setTZ routine for HP-UX systems (should use putenv(strdup(buf))
  instead of putenv(buf)). Suggested by Henry Verdonschot <henry@procura.nl>
- The text output in the bottom strip of the clock is now customizable via
  a format string; idea based on a suggestion by Henry Verdonschot
- Dutch localization (Henry Verdonschot again)
- Norwegian localization; made by Johnny Ljunggren <johnny@navtek.no>
- Synchronize (don't synchronize) switch via "!" at runtime.

Version 3.27, December 29, 2000

- New options -dock (initial clock window cannot be resized or closed), 
  and -updateall (all windows are updated, which, of course, requires 
  more CPU)
- Fixes multiple window bug found by François Massonneau <fmas@celtes.com>

Version 3.26, December 22, 2000

- Fixes segfault bug mentioned by François Massonneau <fmas@celtes.com>

Version 3.25, December 21, 2000

- Simultaneous windows (in arbitrary number...)
  All this required a lot of changes in the Sundata structures, which
  now carry all information about the status of various maps. This
  should make everything much more flexible...
- As a corollary, sunclock should now be dockable

Version 3.22, December 12, 2000 (not released...)

- Fixed incorrect (zero!) distance calculations, minor bug noticed by
  Marc Colling (mcol@village.uunet.lu)

Version 3.21, December 4, 2000

- Bug fixes in the window placement routines (as suggested by Roland
  Rosenfeld)
- Various improvements in the shading algorithm

Version 3.20, November 24, 2000

- Sunclock includes vector map routines which generate Earth maps on the fly.
- These maps are resizeable, they can generate contours or filled areas 
  (3 fill/contour options...)
- Sunclock can optionally handle (non resizeable) external pixmaps as well
- Resizing routines for map and clock windows.
- Shading algorithm showing twilight / luminosity

Version 3.13, October 26, 2000.

- The sunclock package now includes a vector map of the Earth (loosely
  derived from the xearth package by Kirk Lauritz Johnson). The clock and 
  map data files are built from there by the `mapgen` utility. This
  allows users to select the respective size of the clock and map windows 
  at compile time (not yet at run time :-(  but should come soon...)
- New "night/no night" options
- Coordinates can now appear in decimal degrees or degrees, minutes, seconds
- Various small GUI fixes (window placement again...)
  
Version 3.12, October 9, 2000.

- Fix for a bug affecting the configuration of language and color settings 
  through the config file. 

Version 3.11, October 8, 2000.

- Italian localization by Alessio Bragadini <alessio@sevenseas.org>
  Spanish localization by Pedro Gimeno <pgimeno@iname.com>
- Improved window placement, as suggested by 
  Pascal Jermini <Pascal.Jermini@epfl.ch>
- Merged patch by Pedro Gimeno, implementing the wm_delete_window
  protocol.
- Corrected calculation of solartime, sunrise and sunset, which was
  sometimes inaccurate by 10-15 minutes or more.
  Notified by Orn E. Hansen <oe.hansen@gamma.telenordia.se>
- Fix in setTZ routine, related to the putenv/setenv duality
  Thanks to Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.de> for this.
  Hopefully this fixes the persistent problems with timezones...
- Merged window-manager icons from the Debian sources.
- New command line options added (-rcfile -language -jump -progress -menu 
  among others). Time progress and configuration file can now be set 
  arbitrarily.
- The command line options can now also be set through the configuration 
  file, and the version number appears in the tips of 'H' option
  Suggestions by François Massonneau <fmas@celtes.com>

Version 3.10, October 3, 2000.

- Interface has been improved and should be substantially easier to use,
  following some suggestions by François Massonneau <fmas@celtes.com>
- Added Sun position functionality
- Added "hour extension" mode
- Swedish localization by <janoh@telia.com>
- Fixes in monochrome mode
- Other small changes, including bug fixes ( timezone problem, notified by
  Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos <papadopo@shfj.cea.fr> )

Version 3.04, September 7, 2000.

- Fixed tzset() problems on some systems (Linux-Mandrake...) by always
  calling tzset() before each localtime() call.
  Notified by Andy Barlak <andyb@eskimo.com> and
  <dicw@kalevanet.sointula.bc.ca> )

Version 3.03, September 5, 2000.

- Corrected local timezone bug (wasn't correctly initialized nor reset) 
  Problem notified by Philippe Le Hegaret <plh@w3.org>
- Added "1 minute" as one of possible values of progression time
- The value of the sun apparent diameter was wrong (too large) and thus 
  produced slightly inaccurate day length values!
- Fix for SunPro compiler 
  by Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos <papadopo@shfj.cea.fr>

Version 3.02, September 4, 2000.

- Corrected segmentation fault problem, occurring when environment variable 
  LANG was not set (patch from Joerg Plate <Joerg@Plate.cx>)
- Fixed behaviour of window placement, which was somewhat unsatisfactory
- Slight code change for the sake of Solaris compatibility
- Improved sunclock.man, Imakefile and Makefile.noimake
- Added horizontal scroll for bottom text line
- Merged German app-default file provided by several German users
  (including the Debian maintainer Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.de>)

Complete rewrite of the GUI, many bug corrections, improvements and
new functions, resulting in a much more powerful program.

- Added keyboard and mouse controls

- Added switches: coordinates, distances, legal time, solar time
- Added marks, equator, tropic & arctic circles
- Time can be quickly modified forward and backward, so that
  the evolution of sun illumination and seasons can be observed
- Improved time management routines
- Improved and debugged monochrome mode

Version 2.1, June 6, 2000.

  (http://www.ecf.toronto.edu/~mao/)

  my system...)

  selected city is shown with a different color)
- Added further options to support these extensions

Version 1.4, March 4, 1999.

- Changed syntax in ~/.sunclockrc, so as to allow spaces in city names
  (syntax is now  name: latitude longtitude timezone)

==============================================================================

Version 1.3, November 16, 1994.

- Timezone now displayed in icon. Suggested by Rich Gonzalez

    (wmglo@Dent.MED.Uni-Muenchen.DE)

  see a difference can you see a difference.
- Fixed stuff for HP using NEW_CTIME ifdef as suggested by Richard Lloyd
  (R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk). Untested by me on HP.
- Support for Solaris thanks to Dave Yearke (yearke@calspan.com) who also
  pointed out some other bugs and fixes.

==============================================================================

Version 1.1, August 31, 1994.

This is version 1.1 of sunclock. New in this version is support for an
interactive map. This allows you to define places on the map in your
~/.sunclockrc file. These places will show up labelled in the large map,
(not the icon). Clicking on a place will change the clock readout to the
timezone of the that place. See the man page for details.
