==============================================================================

Planned versions 3.3x, 3.40... (features to appear in some order)

- Larger data base of cities/coordinates, with level of size
- Searching cities
- Adding new images formats: png, other vector map formats (the rmap 
  database would be great...)
- Moon phases
- Spherical representation of Earth (?)

Version 3.33, March 21, 2001

- Improvements in the zoom widget, following suggestions by François
  Massonneau <frmas@free.fr> and Ted Rolle <ted@acacia.datacomm.com>
  (there is now a special mode allowing to keep control on the aspect
  when changing the zoom area location)
- Update of Dutch localization by Henry Verdonschot <henry@procura.nl>
  and of Italian localization by Alessio F. Bragadini <alessio@sevenseas.org>
- Minor bug fixes

Version 3.32, March 19, 2001

- Fully functional zoom widget; all images are now zoomable in the
  range 1 ... 100.00 (this does not always make sense, as most JPEG  
  images have insufficient resolution for magnifications exceeding 5)
- More efficient moveNightArea algorithm, resulting in a substantial
  speed improvement when using keys A, B
- Various clean-ups; new flag flag.update allowing a more elegant
  updating process
- Some other minor GUI improvements in menus or events (X Keys now 
  handled properly...)
- Bug fixes

Version 3.31, March 3, 2001

- Minor GUI improvements: the clock window now also has a menu toolbar,
  and the file selector has been slightly improved.
- One or two minor bugs have been fixed (obscure mistake in management of
  pointers, when the initial window was closed before the later ones...)
- A new (unfinished) widget appears: the zoom window - please wait for the
  next release 3.32 for complete zooming capabilities!

Version 3.30, February 26, 2001

- Extensive support for PseudoColor displays, with private colormaps
  being allocated automatically and quantization of colors being performed
  when needed
- .jpg and .xpm formats are fully supported, and all images are resizable

Version 3.29, February 12, 2001 (not widely announced)

- Sunclock now reads .jpg image formats in true-color modes
- .jpg images are resizeable
- The internal vector map has been turned into an externally loadable
  map (a ".vmf" format)

Version 3.28, January 15, 2001

- Patch in setTZ routine for HP-UX systems (should use putenv(strdup(buf))
  instead of putenv(buf)). Suggested by Henry Verdonschot <henry@procura.nl>
- The text output in the bottom strip of the clock is now customizable via
  a format string; idea based on a suggestion by Henry Verdonschot
- Dutch localization (Henry Verdonschot again)
- Norwegian localization; made by Johnny Ljunggren <johnny@navtek.no>
- Synchronize (don't synchronize) switch via "!" at runtime.

Version 3.27, December 29, 2000

- New options -dock (initial clock window cannot be resized or closed), 
  and -updateall (all windows are updated, which, of course, requires 
  more CPU)
- Fixes multiple window bug found by François Massonneau <frmas@free.fr>

Version 3.26, December 22, 2000

- Fixes segfault bug mentioned by François Massonneau <frmas@free.fr>

Version 3.25, December 21, 2000

- Simultaneous windows (in arbitrary number...)
  All this required a lot of changes in the Sundata structures, which
  now carry all information about the status of various maps. This
  should make everything much more flexible...
- As a corollary, sunclock should now be dockable

Version 3.22, December 12, 2000 (not released...)

- Fixed incorrect (zero!) distance calculations, minor bug noticed by
  Marc Colling (mcol@village.uunet.lu)

Version 3.21, December 4, 2000

- Bug fixes in the window placement routines (as suggested by Roland
  Rosenfeld)
- Various improvements in the shading algorithm

Version 3.20, November 24, 2000

- Sunclock includes vector map routines which generate Earth maps on the fly.
- These maps are resizeable, they can generate contours or filled areas 
  (3 fill/contour options...)
- Sunclock can optionally handle (non resizeable) external pixmaps as well
- Resizing routines for map and clock windows.
- Shading algorithm showing twilight / luminosity

Version 3.13, October 26, 2000.

- The sunclock package now includes a vector map of the Earth (loosely
  derived from the xearth package by Kirk Lauritz Johnson). The clock and 
  map data files are built from there by the `mapgen` utility. This
  allows users to select the respective size of the clock and map windows 
  at compile time (not yet at run time :-(  but should come soon...)
- New "night/no night" options
- Coordinates can now appear in decimal degrees or degrees, minutes, seconds
- Various small GUI fixes (window placement again...)
  
Version 3.12, October 9, 2000.

- Fix for a bug affecting the configuration of language and color settings 
  through the config file. 

Version 3.11, October 8, 2000.

- Italian localization by Alessio Bragadini <alessio@sevenseas.org>
  Spanish localization by Pedro Gimeno <pgimeno@iname.com>
- Improved window placement, as suggested by 
  Pascal Jermini <Pascal.Jermini@epfl.ch>
- Merged patch by Pedro Gimeno, implementing the wm_delete_window
  protocol.
- Corrected calculation of solartime, sunrise and sunset, which was
  sometimes inaccurate by 10-15 minutes or more.
  Notified by Orn E. Hansen <oe.hansen@gamma.telenordia.se>
- Fix in setTZ routine, related to the putenv/setenv duality
  Thanks to Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.de> for this.
  Hopefully this fixes the persistent problems with timezones...
- Merged window-manager icons from the Debian sources.
- New command line options added (-rcfile -language -jump -progress -menu 
  among others). Time progress and configuration file can now be set 
  arbitrarily.
- The command line options can now also be set through the configuration 
  file, and the version number appears in the tips of 'H' option
  Suggestions by François Massonneau <frmas@free.fr>

Version 3.04, September 7, 2000.

- Fixed tzset() problems on some systems (Linux-Mandrake...) by always
  calling tzset() before each localtime() call.

  <dicw@kalevanet.sointula.bc.ca> )

  produced slightly inaccurate day length values!

  by Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos <papadopo@shfj.cea.fr>

Version 3.02, September 4, 2000.

- Corrected segmentation fault problem, occurring when environment variable 
  LANG was not set (patch from Joerg Plate <Joerg@Plate.cx>)
- Fixed behaviour of window placement, which was somewhat unsatisfactory
- Slight code change for the sake of Solaris compatibility
- Improved sunclock.man, Imakefile and Makefile.noimake
- Added horizontal scroll for bottom text line

==============================================================================

Version 1.1, August 31, 1994.

This is version 1.1 of sunclock. New in this version is support for an
interactive map. This allows you to define places on the map in your
~/.sunclockrc file. These places will show up labelled in the large map,
(not the icon). Clicking on a place will change the clock readout to the
timezone of the that place. See the man page for details.
