Version 1.1, August 31, 1994.

This is version 1.1 of sunclock. New in this version is support for an
interactive map. This allows you to define places on the map in your
~/.sunclockrc file. These places will show up labelled in the large map,
(not the icon). Clicking on a place will change the clock readout to the
timezone of the that place. See the man page for details.
